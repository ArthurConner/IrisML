# IrisML
Working with Flowers for the machine


## IOS
This uses Cocoa Pods for package management

Go to the root directory and call

    Pod install

Use the workspace not the project and you can be in react land.

## Python

This uses conda. For some reason there needs to be slightly different environments based on os.

These can be found in notebook/

as .yml


[See](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
